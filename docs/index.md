# 3-key

This project is focused on the [3-Key Development Board from Waveshare](https://www.waveshare.com/rp2040-keyboard-3.htm).

It introduces the base firmware written in C++ using the Pico-SDK.

Version [v0.0.2](https://github.com/dtrochow/3-key/releases/tag/v0.0.2) of the firmware adds CTRL+C/CTRL+V capabilities and simple RGB color support (each button has its own color).
